Most of the pyGame code was provided by HyperionDev and edited by myself to add additional functionality. The initial code had the following functionality:

* Player can move up and down
* One enemy player moving from right to left

The following functionality was entered by myself:

* Player can move up, down, left and right
* Three enemies moving from all directions on the screen
* One prize, which if caught, wins you the game
